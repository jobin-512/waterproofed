When used alongside other materials like windows and doors, sealants can effectively prevent water infiltration. However, for this strategy to work, the correct application of the sealants is essential.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Importance of Waterproofing:</span> Waterproofing is another significant technique in the world of balcony leak detection. Waterproof surfaces repel water, preventing it from accumulating and causing damage over time. By leveraging high-quality waterproof materials, we can keep our balconies water intrusion-free.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Flashing Installation:</span> While examining balcony leak detection methods, we shouldn't overlook the importance of installing flashing. As a thin layer of water-resistant material, flashing helps guide water away from the vulnerable points of our balconies, preventing water intrusion.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="mt-10 text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">Benefits of Subsurface Drainage</h2>
          <p>
            The problem of water intrusion isn't just a surface issue; it also involves what goes on beneath the surface. That's where subsurface drainage systems come in.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Understanding Subsurface Drainage:</span> Additionally, subsurface drainage involves installing a system beneath the ground to collect and divert excess water. This strategy prevents water ingress, a major factor contributing to balcony leaks.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">The Utility of Subsurface Drainage:</span> The beauty of subsurface drainage systems lies in their capability to address water intrusion from a different angle – tackling the potential damage caused by water seeping beneath the surface in and around the balcony area.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Preventing Tile Contact With Cement-Laden Materials:</span> A drier balcony is a leak-free balcony. When excessive moisture permeates the tile-cement interface, it can trigger water ingress. Therefore, minimizing tile contact with cement-laden materials is a worthwhile step in preventing balcony leaks.</li>
          </ul>
